What I am going to talk about
-PowerShell Core: What is it and how do I use it.
-When I heard about ATOM I really wanted to do a talk but being from a Microsoft Background what do I know thats Open Source?
-I quickly realized PowerShell Core is open source and it would be a great excuse to learn something and present my findings
-Today we are going to focus on the basics: getting PowerShell Core setup, because unlike PowerShell its not installed by default
	and Using it like you would PowerShell to remote into other machines and pull information
